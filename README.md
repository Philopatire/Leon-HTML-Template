# Leon HTML Template
I am *philopatire*. I coded this template with some design

I have to write their name for their copyrights

1. The Design from [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-psd-agency-template).
2. The Photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
3. The Icons from [Font Awesome 5 Free](https://fontawesome.com).
4. I use [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) Font.
5. I use [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) CSS Framework.

*Finally, I hope to be happy with my template.*
